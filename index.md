    <h4><b>platform</b></h4>
    Using a lean, custom cross-compiled linux, nerves boots directly to the battle hardened BEAM VM, starting your application in seconds.

    <div class="feature-box">
    <h4><b>framework</b></h4>
    Most devices need to get on a network, get discovered, update firmware, and deal with I/O of various kinds.  You're not on your own.
    </div>

    <div class="feature-box">
    <h4><b>tooling</b></h4>
    Cross-compilation can be a total drag.  Our tools make it smooth as silk. Go from "mix new" to running code on your device in minutes.

Nerves is young, but already powers rock-solid shipping industrial products!  Check us out if you are a hearty experimenter and interested in a new way of creating embedded systems.

Nerves is fully open source with a permissive (MIT) license.  Nerves uses Buildroot to provide Linux, so some portions of the platform are licensed under the GPL.
